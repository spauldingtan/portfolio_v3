            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>If you couldn't already tell from the title of my website, my name is Tanner Spaulding.  I'm a spunky 22 year old, born and raised in Utah.  I am married to my best friend Marisa, and am the absolute definition of a geek and/or nerd. I started playing online video games when I was 8 years old. The first online game I played was Everquest, and it started my journey of nerdiness! It's kind of funny, but I actually owe a lot to that game.  Because of the fact that I was playing online, I had to learn how to type to people, and because of how much I played, I got a LOT of practice.  Now, my average typing WPM (words per minute) is 100, and my all time record is 138 WPM.</p>

        <div class="bottomLeft">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Because of my nerdy background, I have always wanted to do something in the technology industry for a living. When I was in Elementary School, anytime anybody asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, I would tell them that I was going to be a computer programmer.  My older brother is a Sr. Javascript Developer, and he was the reason I originally wanted to get into programming. Up until high school I had my mind set on being a programmer.  Then in high school I discovered my love for music, and I was so convinced that I was going to be a famous rockstar, that I lost sight of all of my other goals. However, after giving it a lot of thought, and having a few years worth of experience in the workforce, I came to the conclusion that I need something more reliable, so I came full circle, and got back into computer programming.</p>
            <p>After I finish school in a year, I am going to try and get a job as a Jr. Web Developer at Xactware. If Xactware doesn't need a Jr. Web Developer, then I will look elsewhere, but that will be my start.  I want to specialize in Javascript, and after about 5 years of experience as a Web Developer, I am going to go into software development, still mainly focusing on Javascript. I want to write awesome apps, and to do so I need to learn everything I can about as many programming languages as possible.</p>

        <div class="bottomRight">
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I grew up in one of those tiny towns in Utah that nobody has ever heard of. As a result of that, there weren't many friends who wanted to drive out into the middle of nowhere to hang out with me. Because of this, I had to pretty much entertain myself, and that took on the form of playing video games. My favorite type of games are open-world RPG's such as Oblivion, Skyrim, Witcher 3, Fallout 3 & 4, etc.  I also like playing strategy games like Starcraft, and Hearthstone.</p>
                <p>Aside from video games, I'm also very passionate about music, and I taught myself how to play the guitar, the piano, and sing. I bought a bunch of recording equipment during high school. To teach myself music, I would record myself playing/singing, and listen to the recording to hear all of things I wanted to change, and I would work on them. I would repeat that process for as long as it took for me to feel comfortable enough to perform the song in front of other people.  Once I felt comfortable with a song, I would play every chance I got.  My favorite activity in high school was called "busking".  Busking is when you play your instrument, usually on a street corner, for the purpose of getting people to tip you with money.  I did that as much as I could, and I had a blast! (I also averaged about $40/hr when I busked, which eventually bought me a nicer guitar!)</p>
